1. Install postman
1. Import API Collection ("Import" button in the top left corner of postman app)
1. Import Environment
    * Click the "Gear" in the top right corner
    * Click "Import" in the bottom right corner of the pop up dialog
    * Replace values of environment as appropriate (you will need your own SPN creds)
1. Run the "Get Token" API, which will get a new token and then store that token in your Environment automatically, so all the additional queries should start working after this is run.
